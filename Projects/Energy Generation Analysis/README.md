## README
- This is the README file for the Energy Generation analysis

### Installation
The following Python packages are required to run this script (all are included in the Anaconda Distribution):
- os
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- datetime
- re
- copy
- calendar

### Operation
Once all required packages have been installed, the files can be downloaded to a directory in the Python path and the script can be ran immediately. The script will take several minutes to run due to the size (~150MB) of the raw data needing to load into memory.

### File Directory
- Energy_Generation_Analysis.ipynb: Python code to perform data analysis
- Raw_Data: Folder containing all raw data from 2008-2017 (inclusive)

### Changelog
- Energy_Generation_Analysis_v1_0: Script first uploaded to GitHub.
- Energy_Generation_Analysis_v1_1: Cleaned up the script. Added additional comments.
